%transition rate matrix
-0.250	+0.250
+0.170	-0.170
	%transition rates (NOT transition probablities)
	%row #: inital state
	%col #: final state
	%for states and row/col number, counting starts with 1
	%for example q_{32}=+0.850 is the rate to go from state 3 to state 2
	%matrix has to be NxN (where N is number of states) and rows have to sum to zero
	%in units of 1/s

	%frame rate in units of 1/s

	%minimum trace length in seconds

%lookupCollapse
1	2
	%vector that connects states to degenerate states
	%for example "1 1 2 2" means that states 1 and 2 are mapped to the degenerate state 1
	%and states 3 and 4 are both mapped to degenerate state 2
	%if no collapse is needed, just use 1 2 3 ... N

	%per matrix: covariance matrix for each (degenerate) state
	%rows, cols: in the same channel order as for the mean intensity
	%if, for example, the distribution of each intensity channel
	%in each degenerate state should have a width (sigma of a normal dist) of 1000
	%and no correlation with other channels, then 1000^2 on the diagonal



%per trace level variability
0
	%parameter that controls per trace level heterogeneity
	%the intensity level for each state and intensity channel is drawn
	%from a normal distribution with mu as given in <fluorescence intensity, mean>
	%and a sigma that is sqrt(mu)*parameter
	%turn off by setting to 0



%per trace brightness variability
0
	%parameter that controls per trace brightness heterogeneity
	%an uniformly distributed random number r is drawn from the interval (-1, 1)
	%and all intensities of the current molecule are multiplied by n^r;
	%thus a per trace variability perameter of 2 would result in a 
	%multiplication by a factor from the interval (0.5, 2)
	%turn off by setting to 0
