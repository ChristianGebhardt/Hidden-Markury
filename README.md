# Hidden-Markury (Beta-Version)
FRET Trace Analysis with Hidden-Markov-Model (Jupyter Notebook)

![Software preview](images/Preview.png?raw=true "Software Preview")

## Installation
#### 1. Install a C compiler for hmmlearn (optional, if missing) 
The basic implementation of the Hidden-Markov-Process and the model optimization is based on build-in functions of the python library `hmmlearn`[[1]](#1).
`hmmlearn` requires a C compiler. If you don't have a C compiler installed, the installation of `hmmlearn` will raise an error.

On Windows: 
- Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ -> Select "Tools for Visual Studio 2019" -> "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019" -> Download
- Install "Python development" with "Python native development tools" selected

On Linux/Mac:
- Not tested yet! Installation of hmmlearn (see next section) should raise informative error what to do.

#### 2. Create new environment (optional)
Create a new python environment to install the required packages

Example in Anaconda prompt: `conda create -n hmm`

#### 3. Install hmmlearn
- `pip install --upgrade --user hmmlearn`

If pip installation fails, you can try to directly download and install the wheel.

- (alternative: download wheel from http://pypi.fcio.net/simple/hmmlearn/ and install with `pip install PATH_TO_WHEEL`)

#### 4. Install other required packages

The following packages are needed for full functionality:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy

#### Test system
* Windows 10, 64 bit system
* Anaconda3 (64 bit)
* Python 3.7 environment
* Packages:
  * hmmlearn 0.2.2
  * numpy 1.17.3
  * pandas 0.25.3
  * matplotlib 3.1.1
  * scipy 1.3.1

## Getting Started
#### 1. Clone or download this repository
Clone repository via git

`git clone https://github.com/ChristianGebhardt/Hidden-Markury`

or clone/download repository manually:

#### 2. Open "Hidden-Markury Notebook" in jupyter notebook
* Activate python environment in python console (e.g. `activate hmm` in Anaconda prompt) with required packages installed (see [Installation](#Installation))
* Navigate into repository folder `cd PATH_TO_HIDDEN-MARCURY`
* Start jupyter with command `jupyter notebook`
* Run notebook "Hidden-Marcury Notebook.ipynb"

#### 3. Check installations
There is an extra import file, which checks and imports all the required packages at the beginning. If everything works fine, it should look the following:
![Import preview](images/PreviewImport.png?raw=true "Import Preview")
Otherwise, an error should inform you what to do.

#### 4. Run example analysis
There are several example traces provided in the folder `examples` provided by the "kinSoftChallenge"[[2]](#2). Those traces can directly be used to get familiar with the software.



If you run the notebook cell-by-cell and follow the instructions, you should get the optimized model with the fitted transition rates and the state prediction for the analyzed traces:
